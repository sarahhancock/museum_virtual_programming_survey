        <p class="lead mb-5">This is a survey of the websites of children's museums conducted on May 18th and May 19th of 2020 to evaluate how museum programming is being offered in the United States when most physical museum locations have been forced to close.</p>

        <h1 class="mb-5 text-secondary">Summary</h2>
        <h2 class="mb-3">Methodology</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          A total of 37 children's museums were reviewed for this survey. Of these 37 museums, 29 were found to have some form of virtual programming. These museums were chosen from two sources: 
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>22 museums in California from the Wikipedia <a target="_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_children%27s_museums_in_the_United_States">list of children's museums.</a></li>
          <li>15 museums in the United States from a Parents.com <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.parents.com/fun/vacation/us-destinations/the-10-best-childrens-museums/"> list of the best children's museums.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "lead">
          These sources were chosen because the goal of this survey is to provide virtual programming insight for the Children's Creativity Museum (CCM) in San Francisco, so it made sense to look at similar museums (i.e. in California and "the best").
          For the museums that offered virtual programming, information about the content, educators involved, cost, and technology used were gathered.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">The Main Takeaways</h2>
        <br>
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">Virtual programming is generally being offered for free.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>The only cases of what could be considered “paid workshops” were members-only events. </li>
            <li>For example, The New Children’s Museum is having a members-only event with community workshops in a private Facebook group. </li>
            <li>The Exploratorium is also having a promotion called “May is for Members” with exclusive online programming for members.</li>
            <li> Most museums just provided programming for free and made an easily-accessible “donate” button next to their virtual programming on their website.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">Some museums had other creative ways to look for funding.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>A few museums (KidZone Museum and Children’s Museum of Sonoma County) were distributing at-home kits with supplies and instructions for activities for kids to do at home.</li>
            <li>One museum (ImagineU Children’s Museum) was selling Inspirational Yard Signs.</li>
            <li>There were also more general funding campaigns (The New Children’s Museum) and museums offering materials through an online store (Exploratorium).</li>
            <li>The best funding campaign was from the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum, which is hosting an at-home gala with spaghetti dinner delivery for $400.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="h3 mb-3  text-primary">The most common form of virtual programming is video broadcasts. </div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>The museums that offered virtual programming often had similar strategies, the most common being video broadcasts with storytime or art and science activities.</li>
            <li>Many of the videos had very few views, which raises the question: are kids actually watching them? </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">A variety of technology platforms are being used, including Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and, to a lesser extent, Zoom.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Most museums used Youtube to host their video and embedded the video within the museum website.</li>
            <li>A few museums put videos on Instagram, and these videos seemed to receive more views than those on Youtube.</li>
            <li>Zoom was seen used in a few scenarios, including having a guest speaker for a live Q&A and having a child demonstrate an at-home activity over a live broadcast, but museums generally stuck to more traditional social media platforms.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">A few museums offered engaging online learning platforms, breaking away from the “video stream” mold.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>The Children’s Museum of Houston offered workshops using “Tinkercad” workshops where children could download software and use it to learn Computer-Aided-Design.</li>
            <li>The Minnesota Children’s museum had some original content but mainly focused on compiling a wide variety of “educator-approved” programming, including links to digital tours of other museums.</li>
            <li>The Exploratorium has educational apps available to download and online games; it looks like most of these resources were around before the museum closed, but it still could be an effective model for online learning.</li>
          </ul>
